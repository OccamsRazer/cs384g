Ray Tracing Artifact

To render the gif:
  1) Edit the included render.sh script, removing the echo and exit lines and
     changing RAY_TRACER appropriately
  2) Execute ./render.sh in the same directory as the *.ray and *.png files
  3) This will generate output.gif and frames/*.bmp

The source gif for the textures is original.gif
